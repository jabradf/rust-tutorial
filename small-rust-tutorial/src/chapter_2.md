# Chapter 2-Week 3

Goal:  Up and running with Cloud Computing technology

## Part 1:  Getting Started with Cloud Computing Foundations

* [Review Foundations of AWS Cloud Computings Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lOuZsW7SQstJyBeavXTHwBco4OIoQRkI/edit#slide=id.p1)


### High Level Summary

* Three ways to interact with AWS:  Console, Terminal and SDK (Rust, C#, Python, etc)

#### Demo

* Demo console, cli, sdk

## Part 2: Developing Effective Technical Communication

* Remote work isn't going away ability to work async is critical to success
* Some tips on [Effective Technical Communication](https://paiml.com/docs/home/books/cloud-computing-for-data/chapter01-getting-started/#effective-async-technical-discussions)

### High Level Summary

If someone cannot reproduce what you did, why would they hire you???

* Build 100% reproduceable code: **If not automated it is broken**
    * Automatically tested via GitHub
    * Automatically linted via GitHub
    * Automatically formatted (check for compliance) via GitHub
    * Automatically deployed via GitHub (packages, containers, Microservice)
    * Automatically interactive (people can extend) with GitHub [.devcontainers](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers)
    * Incredible `README.md` that shows clearly what you are doing and an architectural diagram.
    * Optional video demo 3-7 minutes (that shows what you did)
    * Include portfolio 
    * Consider using `rust` [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (what I built this tutorial in) for an extra-special touch.

## Part 3: Using AWS Cloud and Azure Cloud with SDK

### Demo

* AWS Lambda Build and Deploy with Rust
* AWS S3 Account Summarizer with Rust
