* Heuristic:  Rust if you can, Python if you must

### Key Goals in Semester

* Projects should be runnable with minimal instructions as command-line tools or microservices deployed to cloud

### How to Accomplish Goals

#### Two different demo channels

* Weekly Learning Demo:  Projects can take 10-60 minutes on average to complete (Text only explanation, screencast optional).  Must show code via link and explain it via `README.md`.
* Weekly Project Progress Demo:  Demo via screencast, required.  Demo should be 3-7 minutes.
